A super exciting groundbreaking 2d platformer

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

I did not make any of the sprites or sounds used in this game, as cool as that would be. 
These sprites are from Nexon's Maplestory; maybe you've heard of it or even played it.
The sprites were downloaded from BannedStory, an online tool used to make sprite animations with Maplestory graphics.
Included with the sprites was data about the animation: frame delay, offset, sizes, etc.
The sounds were obtained with uhh other methods o_o
